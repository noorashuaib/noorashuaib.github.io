      As quarantine hobbies and trends slowly fade out in light of finding a new normal, our desire for social connection is much more stubborn. We constantly navigate the tides of pandemic restrictions, turning to digital means of preserving social
      connection at a time when physical connection seems almost threatening. This Oscar-nominated film depicts the ways we now perceive digital connection as human connection. While our eyes may be glued to the same screen, the moments in which a
      familiar face pop up can transform, just as the questions in this film transformed into physical objects as each actor reached out to their friend. We encourage viewers to reach out to their own friends (virtually, of course) and locate the
      aspects of human interaction that persevere over a digital divide. This film was created as a commentary on the human tendency to see the self as a source of tethers to those around them. If all it took was four university students and 30
      minutes to digitally recreate the experience of the first day of class, we are sure that our viewers will enrich the discussion we hoped to prompt with The New Normal Project and 20 Questions.
