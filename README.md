**Documentation for Assignment One**
**The New Normal Website**

**Project Description**
This website features the short video we made in one of our Comm Lab classes where we were given a short time frame to come up with a creative video idea through zoom. The video was playful and made the best of the limited time and options we had when filming through zoom, but I wanted to take the short and simple video and make it seem like a more sophisticated and reflective video. So I made the website 'The New Normal' to give the film a sense of drama with the gallery that includes pictures 'upon which to reflect' and the synopsis that encourages the viewers to think about human connection in the COVID era. While the design of the website is meant to be simple and obvious in its interaction, the simplicity is juxtapose the 'deeper' thoughts which the film is supposedly based upon.

**Process**
Although the website was created in a very short time frame, similar to the video, I started out by planning the website with a wireframe on Adobe XD. This allowed me to map out an ideal version of the website I would create and experiment with the placement of different elements. The wireframe proved very useful as I coded the website using html first, as it gave me a watered-down version of the website with which to work with before I gained the skills to apply style. Placing the different elements before adding style was beneficial as I had an idea of the usability of the website before I tried to work on the aesthetics. While adding the style to the website, I was able to debug my html and initial design as the style tested how the elements I was unsure of worked and added a level of complexity to the elements I had already added. Finally, I added the interactivity through Javascript, which is not a significant portion of my website given the timeframe in which I learnt the language. However, Javascript was easier to integrate into the html code than CSS as CSS affected many more areas of my website.
