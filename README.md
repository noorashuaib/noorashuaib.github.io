**Documentation for Assignment One**

**The New Normal Website**


**Project Description**

This website features the short video we made in one of our Comm Lab classes where we were given a short time frame to come up with a creative video idea through zoom. The video was playful and made the best of the limited time and options we had when filming through zoom, but I wanted to take the short and simple video and make it seem like a more sophisticated and reflective video. So I made the website 'The New Normal' to give the film a sense of drama with the gallery that includes pictures 'upon which to reflect' and the synopsis that encourages the viewers to think about human connection in the COVID era. While the design of the website is meant to be simple and obvious in its interaction, the simplicity is juxtapose the 'deeper' thoughts which the film is supposedly based upon.

**Process**

Although the website was created in a very short time frame, similar to the video, I started out by planning the website with a wireframe on Adobe XD. This allowed me to map out an ideal version of the website I would create and experiment with the placement of different elements. The wireframe proved very useful as I coded the website using html first, as it gave me a watered-down version of the website with which to work with before I gained the skills to apply style. Placing the different elements before adding style was beneficial as I had an idea of the usability of the website before I tried to work on the aesthetics. While adding the style to the website, I was able to debug my html and initial design as the style tested how the elements I was unsure of worked and added a level of complexity to the elements I had already added. Finally, I added the interactivity through Javascript, which is not a significant portion of my website given the timeframe in which I learnt the language. However, Javascript was easier to integrate into the html code than CSS as CSS affected many more areas of my website. 

**Reflection/Evaluation:**

While I found the Javascript element of the assignment most interesting (possibly because it is similar to what we covered in Intro to IM), I found html and css to be most challenging when it came to positioning. I would experiment with the margins, paddings, and positions, while also trying to ensure that the website did not lose its layout when resized. Making small changes to an image  or div would sometimes shift my whole page which took time to troubleshoot. 

However, I did enjoy using CSS when it came to styling a web page as it gave life to a bland page. I liked being able to play around with the layout of the pages (despite it sometimes taking time) so create a user experience that was engaging. The CSS Grid feature was most interesting to me as it gave the webpage a more polished look, and I would like to learn more about how to use it and build upon it. The pages with images were easier to find innovative ways to style than the pages with just text, but I hope I can learn to make any type of element more engaging. 

While there were aspects of CSS I enjoyed, I do realise my website is not as clean as I would have liked. There are some aspects of my website, such as the resizing and menu that I realise could be more polished. For the resizing, I would say this was probably what I struggled with most because I could not get all the elements to stay in the same position and not overlap despite trying different ways to position the elements. However, I do think that despite the smaller imperfections and simplicity of the website, I'm happy with how it turned out as the first website I have ever made. I hope to learn more about Javascript, and better my knowledge in html and CSS to make more interactive websites with cleaner finishes.
